map_app
=======

Simple jQuery mobile app that pulls geolocation, logs it to mysql, and shows you a custom icon on map for your current location

Future plans include showing custom icons for each location logged so patterns can be extracted and prediction API's applied.

This app was focused on helping people through therapy or for older people whose children want to understand the emotional health of their parents.

I have also included on the about page the code to integrate google+.
